## DOCUMENTATION

I am currently learning and developing a microservices architecture independently, using Go (Golang) to build modular, efficient, and scalable backend services.

On the frontend side, I use Flutter to create responsive, modern, and cross-platform applications. My focus is on understanding the integration between backend services and mobile applications through APIs, including data communication management, authentication, and real-time synchronization.

The goal of this learning journey is to master microservices design patterns, development pipelines, and best practices for frontend-backend integration, in order to deliver stable, fast, and easily maintainable applications in the future.
